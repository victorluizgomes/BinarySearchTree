CSc 345 Spring 17 - Project 2

Name: Victor Gomes

Files: Proj02_BST.java and BinarySearchTree.java

File: Proj02_BST.java

A Binary Search Tree program that takes a file as an argument 
and reads the file to perform different commands as: 
insert, search, debug, delete, count, preOrder and inOrder.
Each command does something specific to the Tree and some of them will have parameters.
The program assumes all commands in the file are in correct form.

File: BinarySearchTree.java

A Binary Search Tree class that creates a BST and
performs the operations of the commands for Proj02_BST.java

Interesting notes:
I think I did a really good job with style and commenting,
My main file only reads the file as an argument and calls BinarySearchTree
to create a tree and perform the operations necessary. 

Learnings:
The most difficult part for me was implementing the debug command.
But once I figured it out how to write it correctly It was very satisfying to see the graph.
Also, got more confortable with coding recursion, since I used it in almost everything.
